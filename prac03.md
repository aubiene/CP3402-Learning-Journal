# **Week 3: WordPress Workflows & Child Themes**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week, I explored WordPress workflows and child themes by watching the LinkedIn Learning course [Adding Your New Child Theme to a Live Site](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-workflows-2015/adding-your-new-child-theme-to-a-live-site-on-the-web?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=2223545). 

## **Estimated Hours**  
6 hours

## **Content Insights**  
One takeaways from this module was the significance of using a local development environment when working with WordPress. Setting up a site locally allows for testing and modifications without affecting the live version. It also highlighted the benefits of using child themes for customisation. Instead of modifying a parent theme directly, which can lead to issues when updates are released, a child theme allows for modifications while preserving the original themeâ€™s integrity.  

I learned two ways to upload a child theme: using the WordPress Theme Installer for a quick upload or FTP for more control over the files. Since I have primarily been using a one-click installer, I plan to experiment with setting up a local hosting version. This will allow me to gain experience with local development workflows and better understand how WordPress handles file management and theme deployment.  

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Gaining a deeper understanding of child themes and WordPress workflows is essential for building and maintaining customised websites. By working with child themes, I can ensure that future WordPress projects remain flexible and maintainable, without the risk of losing customisations when theme updates are applied. Additionally, learning how to set up and manage a local development environment is an important skill that will improve my efficiency when developing and testing websites.
