# **Week 3: WordPress Workflows & Child Themes**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**  
This week, I explored agile workflows and release planning through the LinkedIn Learning course [Agile at Work: Driving Productive Agile Meetings](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-at-work-driving-productive-agile-meetings). 

## **Estimated Hours**  
5 hours

## **Content Insights**  
One key takeaway from this learning course was how important daily stand-up meetings are in Agile workflows. These quick, focused meetings really help keep teams aligned and ensure that progress is being made. Setting clear goals and discussing any roadblocks helps everyone stay on track, preventing miscommunications and making it easier to meet deadlines.

I also learned that making small, incremental changes throughout a project can significantly reduce complexity. This approach stood out to me because it’s especially valuable in software development. Rather than making large, disruptive changes all at once, focusing on manageable tasks and iterating regularly leads to smoother implementation. I can see how this helps avoid the stress of last-minute fixes.


## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**  
Understanding the importance of daily stand-up meetings and making incremental changes is crucial for improving team collaboration and productivity. These are practical skills that I can apply in both my studies and future career, especially in my current Group Project.

By applying Agile principles, I’ll be able to work more efficiently and prioritise tasks better. As more companies adopt Agile methodologies, having a solid grasp of these practices will enhance my employability.
