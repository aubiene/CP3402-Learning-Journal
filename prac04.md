## Content Insights
I learned about the importance of planning the modern web design process, which is a crucial step before diving into any development. Mapping out the structure and user experience helps keep everything organised and focused. I explored different ways to set up a local development environment, especially for WordPress. While I initially tried using XAMPP, I ran into a lot of issues. Eventually, I learned about Docker and how it simplifies the setup process for local WordPress sites. I didn’t realise how much easier it would be to manage environments with Docker until I gave it a try.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I successfully set up a local WordPress site using Docker, which was a huge win. While I struggled with XAMPP, Docker proved far more reliable and efficient. The tutorials I watched helped me understand the process of setting up local environments and gave me a clearer picture of why Docker is so widely used in development. This knowledge will be useful in future projects, especially when working with WordPress or any other platform that requires a local environment. Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of being open to trying new tools and techniques, even if things don’t go as planned the first time.
