## Week 2: Introduction and Web Design

### Learning Activites & Resources: 
I reviewed the WordPress essentials by watching the LinkedIn learning course [WordPress Essentials Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-essential-training-2023).
I learned how to launch and edit a Joomla site by watching several YouTube tutorials. The following resources were particularly helpful: [HOW TO INSTALL Joomla 4 on XAMPP, cPanel & AWS:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF8MCvSTJLI&list=PLCxCi7K8musaNBepi-Pdj9Ij9nSwfM8J1). [Build a website from scratch with Joomla 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkaEcCTyuH4). Additionally, I found that WebTech with Brett has several in-depth videos explaining Joomla, which provided valuable insights.

### Estimated Hours: 
- 12 hours 

### Content Insights: 
The learning resources introduced me to Joomla and WordPress. Exploring Joomla helped me understand the installation process, the interface, and how to customise my site. Initially, I found the Joomla structure confusing, but after the tutorials, I gained a clearer understanding of managing and editing the homepage effectively.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Gaining hands-on experience with Joomla has allowed me to build some knowledge of CMS management. Learning to launch and install Joomla, customise content, and manage the site structure will benefit future projects. I also would like to reiterate the importance of combining theory with practice; while watching tutorials helped, actively working within Joomlaâ€™s environment solidified my understanding.
