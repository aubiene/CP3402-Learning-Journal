## Week 1 : Introduction and Web Design

### Learning Activites & Resources: 
- **Reviewed** web design and development concepts by watching the LinkedIn Learning course [Introduction to Web Design and Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-web-design-and-development).
- **Refreshed** my memory on how to deploy GitHub Pages by watching a tutorial on YouTube: [Deploying GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k&t=311s).
- Explored **Figma** for UI/UX design and began experimenting with **CodePen** for coding practice and prototyping.

### Estimated Hours: 
- 8 hours 

### Content Insights: 
- The learning resource reintroduced me to key web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Understanding how these three languages work together to structure, style, and add interactivity to a website has made the web development process much clearer and has helped me see how each piece fits into the bigger picture of creating a website. I also explored various tools to enhance web design and development, including Figma for UI/UX design and CodePen for live coding and experimentation. Figma will help me create wireframes and prototypes, while CodePen allows me to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real time.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
- Learning how to deploy websites with GitHub Pages and experimenting with UI/UX design using Figma are skills I can immediately apply to future projects. I also realised how important it is to combine theory with practice. Watching tutorials is helpful, and hands-on experimentation through platforms like CodePen will be an excellent way to learn. Moving forward, Iâ€™ll continue this learning approach by moving between tutorials and practical exercises.
